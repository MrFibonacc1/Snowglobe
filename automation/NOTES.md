# Integration notes — H Company & Composio

How the two external integrations work and how to flip them from mock or
unavailable to real. The service runs without integration keys, but Composio
steps fail closed until the external action is confirmed.

## H Company agent (`steps/h_agent.py`)

⚠️ **Update:** the open-source `surfer-h-cli` we first targeted is **deprecated
and unmaintained**, and its hosted endpoint (`api.hcompanyprod.fr`) is dead.
H's supported path is now the hosted **Computer-Use Agent API** — a fully
hosted browser agent, so **no local Selenium/Chrome needed.** We rebuilt the
step against it.

Modes (`H_AGENT_MODE`):

| Mode | What happens |
|---|---|
| `mock` (default) | Simulates a 4s run; demo-safe, no keys. |
| `agent_api` | **Recommended.** Calls the hosted Agent API over HTTP (httpx). No browser. |
| `surfer_cli` | Legacy. Deprecated upstream; only for self-hosting Holo via vLLM. Needs local Chrome. |

### agent_api setup (this is all it takes)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt        # httpx — nothing else
export H_AGENT_MODE=agent_api
export HAI_API_KEY=hk-...               # from portal.hcompany.ai
# optional: export HAI_AGENT_REGION=us  (default eu)
#           export HAI_AGENT_NAME=h/web-surfer-flash
```

No clone, no venv, no browser. The step:
1. `POST {base}/sessions` with `{"agent": "h/web-surfer-flash", "messages":[{"type":"user_message","message":"Go to <url>. <instructions>"}]}`
2. polls `GET {base}/sessions/{id}` until `finished_at` / terminal status
3. returns `session_id`, **`agent_view_url`** (a live/replay link — surface it in
   the dashboard runs view!), `status`, `outcome`, and `latest_answer`.

The workflow treats the polling budget as a hard completion boundary. If the
session is still running when `H_AGENT_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 300s) expires, or
if it reaches a terminal state without a non-empty answer, the agent step and
overall run fail and all dependent steps are skipped. The failed step retains
the session ID, replay URL, status, step count, and duration for diagnosis; it
is never reported as done and `{{steps.<id>.answer}}` is never rendered as an
empty downstream message. For legitimately long missions, set a larger
per-step `timeout_sec` instead of accepting partial output.

Base URLs: EU `https://agp.eu.hcompany.ai/api/v2` · US `https://agp.hcompany.ai/api/v2`.

### Verified status (2026-07-11, evening) — ✅ FULLY WORKING

The earlier "sessions stall at steps: 0" issue is **resolved** (entitlement
kicked in). Verified end to end with the team key:
- ✅ Auth: `GET /sessions` → 200 (a rejected key gets **403**, not 401).
- ✅ Standalone: `python test_h_connection.py` → agent navigated example.com
  and answered in ~22s (status=idle, steps=2).
- ✅ **Full pipeline**: fake spill event → workflow engine → h_agent step →
  real hosted session → answer + `agent_view_url` captured in the run output
  (22.7s). Agents also degrade gracefully: pointed at the placeholder
  forms.gle URL, the agent completed and *reported* the link was dead.

Ops notes:
- The key lives in `automation/.env` (gitignored); `envload.py` auto-loads it
  for both `main.py` and `test_h_connection.py` — no exports needed.
- `H_AGENT_MODE` still defaults to `mock` (safe). Run real mode with
  `H_AGENT_MODE=agent_api uvicorn main:app --port 8000`, or add
  `H_AGENT_MODE=agent_api` to `.env` to make it the default.
- Each h_agent step consumes one hosted session (~20-30s) — replace the
  seeded placeholder form URL with a real Google Form before enabling real
  mode broadly, or every spill event spends a session on a dead link.

### Alternatives / notes
- SDK: `pip install hai-agents` gives a typed client (`Client(api_key=...)`,
  sync + async). We use raw HTTP to keep the automation service dependency-free
  beyond httpx; swap in the SDK if you prefer typed responses.
- Models API (`https://api.hcompany.ai/v1/`, OpenAI-compatible) serves the raw
  Holo VLMs — a different product from the Agent API; not needed here.
- Legacy self-host: `surfer-h-cli/launch.sh` runs a local viewer on :3000;
  requires vLLM-served Holo + working local Chrome (see gotcha below).

### Legacy Chrome gotcha (surfer_cli mode only)
On Chrome 150 + selenium 4.46, the local Selenium agent fails with
`SessionNotCreatedException: unable to discover open pages` (matching driver,
both headless/headed). Irrelevant to `agent_api`. If you must use surfer_cli,
patch `simple_browser.py::open_browser` with a fresh `--user-data-dir` and
`--headless=new`.

## Composio (`steps/composio_step.py`)

One SDK for the API-shaped actions (Slack, Drive, Sheets), auth per account.

```bash
pip install composio
composio login                                  # or export COMPOSIO_API_KEY=...
composio connected-accounts link slack          # OAuth, once per toolkit
composio connected-accounts link googledrive
composio connected-accounts link googlesheets
```

Executor calls `client.tools.execute(slug=…, user_id=…, arguments=…)`. Slugs
(verify with `composio tools info <SLUG>` after linking):

| Our action | Composio slug | Arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `slack_message` | `SLACK_SEND_MESSAGE` | channel, text |
| `drive_upload` | `GOOGLEDRIVE_UPLOAD_FILE` | file_to_upload, folder_to_upload_to |
| `sheets_append` | `GOOGLESHEETS_BATCH_UPDATE` | spreadsheet_id, sheet_name, values |

Without `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`, actions raise an execution error and the workflow
run is marked failed. A missing integration can no longer animate as delivered.

### Verified status (2026-07-11) — ⚠️ key reads but cannot execute

Ran `python test_composio_connection.py` with the provided key:
- ✅ **AUTH**: key is valid for the management API (lists 6 connected accounts).
- ✅ **SDK/code path**: our `composio_step.py` call shape matches SDK 0.17.1.
  Fixed one real bug — 0.17+ requires a toolkit version for manual execution,
  so we now pass `dangerously_skip_version_check=True`.
- ❌ **EXECUTE**: `tools.execute` returns **401 "Invalid API key"** even for a
  no-auth utility tool. Confirmed at the HTTP level: the SAME key + same
  `x-api-key` header gets **200 on every GET** (`/api/v3.1/connected_accounts`,
  `/tools/...`) but **401 on `POST /api/v3.1/tools/execute/...`**. Same host
  (`backend.composio.dev`), so it's not region/URL — the key is scoped to
  read/management only. No code change (header, version, user_id) can fix it.
- ❌ **Accounts**: the only ACTIVE connected account is `reddit`. There is **no
  Slack / Google Sheets / Google Drive** connection — which is what our
  workflows use.

**Fail-closed execution:** a 401, missing linked account, missing key, or SDK
response without `successful: true` fails the Composio step and the overall
workflow. `GET /status` separately reports key presence, execution readiness,
and active Slack/Sheets/Drive accounts so the dashboard cannot equate a key
with delivery.

**To make it actually run (two independent blockers, both user-side):**
1. Get a Composio key with **tool-execution** rights (or enable execution on
   this account/plan) — verify with `test_composio_connection.py` step 3 → OK.
2. Link the toolkits (one OAuth click each, opens in a browser):
   `composio connected-accounts link slack` (+ googlesheets, googledrive),
   done under the same `user_id` our steps use (`COMPOSIO_USER_ID`, default
   `default`). Existing accounts on this key use `user_id=local`.
Once both are green, `composio` steps run for real with zero code changes.
Meanwhile the generic `mcp` step is a working alternative (H's MCP verified).

## MCP step (`steps/mcp_step.py`) — the flexible integration lane

A generic step that calls **any tool on any MCP server** (streamable HTTP):

```json
{ "type": "mcp", "config": {
    "server_url": "https://<your-mcp-server>/mcp",
    "tool": "sheets_append_row",
    "arguments": { "spreadsheet": "incidents",
                   "values": ["{{event.timestamp}}", "{{event.location}}"] } } }
```

- Templating applies inside `arguments`, so camera data flows into the tool.
- Auth: `MCP_SERVER_TOKEN` env (or per-step `token`) is sent as a Bearer
  header; servers with their own OAuth (hosted Google MCPs) handle it after a
  one-time account link on the server's side.
- Defaults: `MCP_SERVER_URL` env is used when a step omits `server_url`.
- Verified against `mock_mcp_server.py`
  (`.venv/bin/uvicorn mock_mcp_server:app --port 8200`) — full pipeline:
  fake spill → workflow → mcp step → tool call with templated args. ✅

For Google Sheets/Drive specifically, point it at any Google Workspace MCP
server (hosted ones exist — e.g. Composio's per-toolkit MCP URLs — or run a
community Google MCP server; either way the tool names come from that
server's `tools/list`). Check the exact tool names/args before the demo.
